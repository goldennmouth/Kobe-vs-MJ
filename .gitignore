			<h1>Who's the greatest Shooting Guard to ever play in the NBA? Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant?</h1>
	<p>My personal top two favourite players to ever play the game of basketball. Debated heavily amongst avid basketball fans; who is better... Kobe or MJ? Although my personal favourite is Kobe Bryant -I think mostly because i grew up watching his career unfold- after reading many article and listening to plenty interviews the Michael takes the cake. His overall body of work heavily outweighs Kobe's, with a couple more MVP awards, championships, and other accolades. Saying this, both are Hall of Famers and two of the greatest to ever play the sport.  </p>
